# PatGPT - by @patnealcodes

- Built with React && Vite
- Embeddings and other neat vector magic powered by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
- Artisinal, hand-crafted non-framework CSS.
- SVGs organically sourced from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).
- I don't store or track anything entered, but it uses the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/product).
- Any persistence is stored on the client's local storage in their browser.
- No cookies, no tracking, no analytics, no ads, no nothing.
- I'm not responsible for anything you do with this. It's just a fun project.

- TODO: The rest of the readme
